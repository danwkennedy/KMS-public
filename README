Kinect Management Server

The Kinect Management Server (KMS) is a service for the "Pursuit" game that detects and manages up to four 
players using two Microsoft Kinect sensors via Annonymous Pipes.

Design:
The KMS is composed of four modules:
	- The main KinectManagementServer
	- The KinectClient
	- The GestureModule
	- The SocketServer

Kinect Management Server:
This is the entry point for the service. During initialization, the KMS searches for all Kinects connected to the 
system via USB. For each Kinect found, the service will spawn a Kinect Client that will manage that Kinect. The 
KMS will also create a GestureModule for detecting and reporting player poses and gestures. Finally, the KMS connects 
to a Unity game instance via the Socket Server component.

Kinect Client:
The Kinect Client is responsible for starting and managing one Kinect sensor. After starting the sensor, the Kinect Client 
streams live skeleton data to the KMS by means of Interprocess Communication. Right now, the Kinect Client can stream to 
the server via Annomymous Pipes or TCP sockets.

Gesture Module:
The Gesture Module is responsible for analysing the skeleton data received from the Kinect Clients and determining whether 
a pose or gesture has been executed by a player. The Gesture Module will then post these events to the KMS for transmittal 
to the Unity game via the Socket Server.

Socket Server:
The Socket Server is responsible for gathering the pose and gesture events, parsing them to a JSON string, which is then 
streamed via a socket to an instance of the Unity game. The Unity game can then act appropriately on these events.
